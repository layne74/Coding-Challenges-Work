## Console based Snakes and Ladders game

Welcome to the console based Snakes and Ladders game. This game is a simple console based game where two players battle it out to reach the end of the board. 

## How the game works

The game is played on a 10x10 board meaning first to land on 100 wins. The game is played by rolling a pair of dice, if you roll two of the same number you get an extra turn. if you roll past 100 you will bounce back the number of spaces you rolled past 100. If you have 2 roles and the first role takes you to 100, you will not have to roll again, thus winning the game.

If the player lands on a snake head, they will move back to the tail of the snake. If the player lands on a ladder, they will move to the top of the ladder. The first player to reach the end of the board wins the game.
